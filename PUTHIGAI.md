Our Therapies 

Detox Therapy: 
According to Nature cure, all the diseases that we get in the physical form of body is due to the one and only accumulation of toxic matters in the body. 
The toxic accumulation in the body develops acne, pimples, cold, cough, fewer, kidney stones, bladder stones, blocks in the arteries, cholesterol, digestive disorders, obesity, diabetes, stroke, liver cirrhosis, cancer and what not. 
Naturally, the priority of our body’s immune system is to eliminate toxins from our body. When a piece of dust falls in our eyes, the eyes tears automatically. Why because, the tears are formed to eliminate the toxic matters. When a tiny particle of dust gets into our nose, we sneeze naturally. Why because, to push out the toxic matter. Likewise, our skin, mucous membranes, tears, earwax, mucus, stomach acid, lymph nodes ect., does different levels of protective and destructive defence mechanisms in our body against the toxic matters. 
On top of that we are accumulating toxic matters in our body because of our improper Diet, Sedentary lifestyle, Stressful mind, also due to today’s  environmental factors, the intake of medicines ect. 
Our Detox therapy is a natural and easily adaptable method with specific diet, exercises and nature cure practices for a smaller duration of time. 
Focus Areas: 
Our Therapy focuses on Colon Cleansing, Kidney Detox, Skin Detox, Lung Detox and Liver Detox. Our therapies include, Enema, Food decoctions, Steam, Sun Bathing, Wet packs, detox exercises, Pranayama, etc. 
Our Detox therapy is the primary and principal therapy to be practiced as mandatory before starting any other chronic disease’s Reversal Programs to experience the effectiveness.  
Diet Therapy: 
Food plays a vital role in our lives. In fact, the divine has made sure that the food is been created according to the organism before even their birth. 
Food is the Life giver. It sustains our health and nourishes us. Food is closely associated with every feature of our existence.  Food is associated with worship and divinity, celebration and mourning, family gathering, community feasting, etc. Food is Physically, Mentally, Emotionally and socially connected with every feature of our existence. 
Modern science is grouping the food as its energy giving, body building and protective & regulatory functions. According to its functions it makes changes in the physical body. Food is also emotionally connected. If one is stressed or feeling depressed, tends to eat a lot of sweets. That leads to lot of complications both physically and emotionally. It is essential that one must understand what changes a particular food can make in order to sustain health.   
Why Diet Therapy: 
Nutrition and Health Education programs were promoted initially to overcome the nutrition deficiencies of people. But in today’s modern lifestyle, all the diseases that we are facing is not due to deficiency of food, It is because of excess eating.  It is very important that one must understand the right food intake, right amount and right time to be taken and most importantly analysing what changes does it make in our physical body and mind. 
We @ Uyirmei have certified Nutritionist and Health Educators. We educate and guide people on the modern scientific nutrition education as well as the traditional yogic philosophy of food. 
We approach the food in integration of, 
•	Modern Scientific Balanced Diet 
•	Traditional Tamilian Science of 6 Taste food (arusuvai unavu) 
•	Yogic Philosophy of Mithahara and Satvic Food
•	Nature cure concept of Whole-Plant based Diet 
We educate and guide on easily adaptable changes in healthy eating as well as healthy cooking 
 
Yoga Therapy: 
According to Yoga Therapy, any disease in the physical form of the body (VYADHI) is perculated from Mind (AADHI). So, we will need to treat the Mind before treating the Physical form of the Body.  
We are not just the physical form or mental form. As per the holistic multi-dimensions called Koshas (sheaths), there are five levels, Annamayakosha (Physical Body), Pranamayakosha (Life Energy), Manomayakosha (Mind), Vignyanamayakosha (Intellect), Anandamayakosha (Blissful state). All the five sheaths / levels are interactive and connected. Holistic wellness is very much related in incorporating all the 5 levels. 
Yoga therapy is the process of empowering individuals to progress toward improved health and well-being through the application of Yoga in all 5 levels.
We tailor the programs of an individual to the specific conditions and requirements. Such as, Detox, Weight Management, Diabetic care, Positive health, Spinal care, Immune boosting, etc. 
We have designed our yoga therapies in 4 levels, 
•	Level 1 : Flexibility 
•	Level 2 : Endurance
•	Level 3 : Deep Focus 
•	Level 4 : Sustainability  
We Incorporate the complete package of Yoga Asanas for different parts of the body, Variety of Breathing exercises and Pranayama, Different and easily adaptable Meditation techniques and practices, Deep Relaxation techniques, improving Social Health, Conscious and Subconscious Mind coordination techniques, Working on the deep inner self techniques, etc.,  
Nature Cure Practices: 
The Nature protects us, guides us and leads us in all the ways and means. 
Natural resources such as, The Sun, Water, Mud, Air, herbs, ect., has abundance of healing power. In today’s lifestyle we do not even get exposed to Natural abundance. We live in closed rooms, where we do not get fresh air, sunlight, etc. 
One of the major drawbacks of modern era is working on the quick fixes. We do not have time to wait. If we give it some time for everything, nature has the solution. Definitely we will need to have medical interventions for the required conditions. But not for everything. Nature has powerful healing solutions. 
We incorporate techniques like, Sun Bathing, Sun Gazing, Banana Leaf Therapy, Mud Therapy, Steam Therapy, Hydro Therapy, Dorn Therapy, etc.

Spiritual Enhancement 

Spirituality is always connected with religion and belief. Though Religion and Spirituality have similar aspects in foundation, they are different when it comes to practice. Religion is community-based system of belief. While spirituality is to realise the true potential of the self and the ultimate divine power. It is very important for every individual to realise the true potential of self. That will determine the values and purpose of life of an individual.  
Unlike Physical health, Mental health and Social health, one must nurture their spiritual health as well. Spiritual health will help to create balance between physical, mental and social aspects. 
When we speak about wellness it is always connected with spirituality. It helps in inculcating good values and discipline in life such as taking care of self, being positive, creating a connection with society, developing harmony with everyone, ect.  
Why Spiritual Education for Modern lifestyle: 
In today’s world, Technology and Intelligence is given importance for growth.  We discover everything possible. So, in this fast-moving world we ignore to realise the self-potential and inner peace.  Somehow, we are giving importance to the physical health. We value exercise and sports for our physical and mental health. Modern lifestyle as a whole, values intellectual and physical growth. Unfortunately, it does not place a high value on spiritual development. When we focus on nurturing the spiritual health, we will be the most happiest person in the world. 
What are the outcomes of Spiritual Education for Modern lifestyle:
•	Attain the Inner peace 
•	Reduction in stress. Chronic stress is harmful to both physical and mental health
•	Reduce blood pressure
•	Improve the functioning of immune system
•	Reduction in depression
•	Increased social interactions
•	Lower rates of anxiety
•	Overall improvement in mental well-being
•	Increase longevity
The Concept of 5 Layered Holistic Education on Realization of Self
At Uyirmei, we focus spirituality on the concept of realisation of self and attaining the full potential of self. To realise the true self, one must understand the self from all the angles. Physical Body, Life Energy, Mind, Intellect and Blissful State. Every aspect is interlinked and associated with each other. Holistic wellness and realisation the true self is about the coordination and maintaining harmony between all the five aspects. Along with that maintaining harmony between Self, Society and Nature. 
Our program will help in discovering, 
•	Who am I? 
•	What I want to be? 
•	What is the purpose of life? 
•	How do I attain the purpose of my life?
